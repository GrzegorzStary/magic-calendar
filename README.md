## UI/UX Design
The wireframes for the website's design can be found [here.](/documentation/wireframes/magic-calendar.pdf)
The wireframes for this project are very rudimentary and designed to give us a foundational idea on how to structure the website. Early in the project, the team decided to use Bootstrap as a framework for the site's design. This allowed the use of the in-built class templates to provide a mobile-first, responsively designed site. 

The website was designed as a celebration of festivals and holidays around the world - however, given the timing of the project as being incepted close to  Christmas, we decided to use Christmas-y colours such as red, green and off-white for our design.
These colours evoke imagery of the holiday season (particularly of Santa Claus and elves) and are designed to remind the user of the purpose of the site.

While the wireframes themselves were rudimentary, regular discussion was had between the team members on the appearance of the site via Slack; the overall appearance of the website was a collaborative effort with the wireframes being designed by Morgana and Anna contributing assets for the design of the cards using Canva and Adobe Firefly.
