## About
Magic Calendar is a festive, advent-style calendar with selectable cards. 
The purpose of the calendar is to provide insight into many of the widely celebrated seasonal festivals and holidays around the world. 
Our project is unique as it uses the motif of a local holiday tradition (advent calendars) to provide content to the user - the nature of the advent calendar format allows for new content to be provided every day.

## Goal
### Problem Statement:
**At this time of year, everyone is thinking about celebrating the festive period - but we don't actually know much about how the world celebrates. Our project aims to provide insight into the many kinds of celebrations that occur around the world.**

### Objectives:
- To create a website which allows the user to learn more about different festival celebrations around the world.
- The website should be fun, enticing, and allow the user to find out more on holidays and festivals they're interested in.
- The website should be colorful to reflect the festive theme.
### Target Audience:
- Users looking to find out more about how festivals are celebrated around the world.
- Users looking for an interactive and fun way to learn about other cultures.

### Benefits:

## UI/UX Design
The wireframes for the website's design can be found [here.](/documentation/wireframes/magic-calendar.pdf)
The wireframes for this project are very rudimentary and designed to give us a foundational idea on how to structure the website. 
Early in the project, the team decided to use Bootstrap as a framework for the site's design. 
This allowed the use of the in-built class templates to provide a mobile-first, responsively designed site. 

The website was designed as a celebration of festivals and holidays around the world - however, given the timing of the project as being incepted close to  Christmas, we decided to use Christmas-y colours such as red, green and off-white for our design.
These colours evoke imagery of the holiday season (particularly of Santa Claus and elves) and are designed to remind the user of the purpose of the site.

While the wireframes themselves were rudimentary, regular discussion was had between the team members on the appearance of the site via Slack; the overall appearance of the website was a collaborative effort with the wireframes being designed by Morgana and Anna contributing assets for the design of the cards using Canva and Adobe Firefly.
