    <h5>History of Stupid Toy Day</h5>
    <p>Toys play a vital role in childhood, but let’s be honest—some are just plain silly! On this day, we look back
      fondly at the bizarre collection of toys that filled our playrooms, each boasting its own outrageous sounds
      and sticky textures. Stupid Toy Day was first observed in 2017, providing a perfect opportunity to reflect on
      the toys that made us laugh and cringe in equal measure.</p>
