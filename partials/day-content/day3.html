    <p>Let’s Hug Day, celebrated on December 3rd, is all about embracing the warmth and comfort that hugs bring.
      Hugs are versatile gestures of affection; they can express joy when we’re happy, provide solace when we’re
      feeling low, and serve as a perfect way to reconcile after a disagreement. Not only do hugs make us feel good
      emotionally, but they also release hormones that can help lower stress and blood pressure, making them
      beneficial for our health!</p>

    <h5>A Bit of History</h5>
    <p>While the exact origins of Let’s Hug Day are unclear, some believe it was inspired by Kevin Zaborney, who
      created National Hugging Day on January 31st. The idea behind both days is to encourage people to show
      affection and support through hugs. The word "hug" comes from the Old Norse word "hugga," which means "to
      comfort," highlighting the nurturing aspect of this simple yet profound gesture.</p>
