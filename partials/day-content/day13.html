  <p>National Cocoa Day, celebrated on December 13, is a delightful occasion dedicated to enjoying the rich and
    comforting flavours of cocoa. This day invites everyone to indulge in a warm cup of cocoa, whether it's the
    classic hot cocoa made with cocoa powder or the luxurious hot chocolate crafted from ground chocolate, making
    it a perfect time to explore various recipes and toppings.</p>

  <h5>History of National Cocoa Day</h5>
  <p>Cocoa has a fascinating history that dates back over 5,000 years. Originally enjoyed as a bitter beverage by
    ancient Mesoamerican cultures, it was flavoured with vanilla and chilli rather than sugar. European explorers
    discovered cocoa in South America and initially found its taste unappealing, but it later became a luxury
    drink sweetened for the wealthy. The invention of powdered chocolate in 1828 paved the way for the chocolate
    bar and instant hot cocoa we know today.</p>

      filled with cocoa and marshmallows create a fun and unique way to enjoy your drink.</li>
    <li>Experiment with Toppings: Elevate your hot cocoa by trying different toppings like marshmallows, candy
      canes, or caramel. For a twist, consider adding spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavour.</li>
