        <p>Let’s Hug Day, celebrated on December 3rd, is all about embracing the warmth and comfort that hugs bring.
          Hugs are versatile gestures of affection; they can express joy when we’re happy, provide solace when we’re
          feeling low, and serve as a perfect way to reconcile after a disagreement. Not only do hugs make us feel good
          emotionally, but they also release hormones that can help lower stress and blood pressure, making them
          beneficial for our health!</p>
        <p>
        <h5>A Bit of History</h5><br>
        While the exact origins of Let’s Hug Day are unclear, some believe it was inspired by Kevin Zaborney, who
        created National Hugging Day on January 31st. The idea behind both days is to encourage people to show
        affection and support through hugs. The word "hug" comes from the Old Norse word "hugga," which means "to
        comfort," highlighting the nurturing aspect of this simple yet profound gesture.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>How to Celebrate Let’s Hug Day</h5><br>
        Here are some fun and meaningful ways to celebrate this heartwarming day:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Give a Big Hug: Start your day by hugging a family member or friend. It’s a wonderful way to spread love
            and
            set a positive tone for the day!</li>
          <li>Hug a Stranger (with Permission): If you’re feeling adventurous, why not ask someone if they’d like a hug?
            Just remember to respect personal space!</li>
          <li>Learn About the Benefits of Hugs: Take some time to explore how hugging can reduce stress, improve heart
            health, and boost your immune system. Sharing this knowledge can inspire others to embrace more hugs in
            their
            lives.</li>
          <li>Host a Hugging Party: Gather friends and family for a cosy get-together where everyone can share hugs and
            enjoy each other’s company. You could even create fun activities centred around hugs!</li>
          <li>Send Virtual Hugs: For those who can’t be with you in person, send virtual hugs through messages or social
            media. A simple text or video call can brighten someone’s day!</li>
        </ul>
        Let’s Hug Day is a beautiful reminder of the power of human connection. So grab your loved ones, spread some
        joy, and let the hugs flow!

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>St Nicholas Day, celebrated on 6 December in the West (and 19 December in some Eastern Christian countries),
          honours the life and legacy of Saint Nicholas, the inspiration behind Santa Claus and Father Christmas. Known
          for his kindness, St Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Myra (modern-day Turkey) who dedicated his life to
          helping the poor, sick, and children. His generosity is legendary, including secretly leaving coins in shoes,
          a tradition that inspired modern Christmas stockings.</p>
        <p>
        <h5>The History of St Nicholas Day</h5><br>
        Saint Nicholas was renowned for his charitable acts, including a famous tale where he provided dowries for three
        impoverished sisters by secretly leaving gold in their shoes. Over time, his acts of kindness inspired
        celebrations across Europe. In countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, children leave out their
        shoes or special boots on the eve of St Nicholas Day to find small gifts or treats in the morning. These
        traditions eventually influenced the creation of Santa Claus and Father Christmas as we know them today.</p>
        <p>
        <h5>How to Celebrate St Nicholas Day</h5><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave Out Shoes or Stockings: Embrace tradition by leaving shoes or stockings out for small surprises like
            chocolate coins or trinkets.</li>
          <li>Have a Feast: Celebrate with family and friends by enjoying a festive meal together.</li>
          <li>Help Someone in Need: Honour St Nicholas’s spirit by donating to charity or helping someone in your
            community.</li>
          <li>Decorate Boots or Stockings: Get creative by decorating your own St Nicholas-themed stockings or boots.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>Why We Love St Nicholas Day</h5><br>
        This day reminds us of the importance of generosity and kindness. It’s an opportunity to focus on giving rather
        than receiving, bringing families together while spreading joy and goodwill. Whether through small gifts,
        festive meals, or acts of charity, St Nicholas Day is a beautiful way to kick off the holiday season with love
        and compassion.</p>

        candy machine and showcased it at the 1904 World’s Fair. Since then, it has become a staple at fairs, festivals,

        <h5>Description for card:</h5><br>
        St Nicholas Day, celebrated on December 6th, honours the legacy of Saint Nicholas, a kind-hearted figure known
        for his generosity and care for the needy. This festive day encourages acts of kindness, such as leaving gifts
        in shoes and sharing a hearty feast with loved ones, all while remembering the spirit of giving that inspired
        the modern-day Santa Claus.
