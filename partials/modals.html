        <p>Let’s Hug Day, celebrated on December 3rd, is all about embracing the warmth and comfort that hugs bring.
          Hugs are versatile gestures of affection; they can express joy when we’re happy, provide solace when we’re
          feeling low, and serve as a perfect way to reconcile after a disagreement. Not only do hugs make us feel good
          emotionally, but they also release hormones that can help lower stress and blood pressure, making them
          beneficial for our health!</p>

        <h5>A Bit of History</h5>
        <p>While the exact origins of Let’s Hug Day are unclear, some believe it was inspired by Kevin Zaborney, who
          created National Hugging Day on January 31st. The idea behind both days is to encourage people to show
          affection and support through hugs. The word "hug" comes from the Old Norse word "hugga," which means "to
          comfort," highlighting the nurturing aspect of this simple yet profound gesture.</p>

        <h5>How to Celebrate Let’s Hug Day</h5>
        <p>Here are some fun and meaningful ways to celebrate this heartwarming day:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Give a Big Hug: Start your day by hugging a family member or friend. It’s a wonderful way to spread love
            and set a positive tone for the day!</li>
          <li>Hug a Stranger (with Permission): If you’re feeling adventurous, why not ask someone if they’d like a hug?
            Just remember to respect personal space!</li>
          <li>Learn About the Benefits of Hugs: Take some time to explore how hugging can reduce stress, improve heart
            health, and boost your immune system. Sharing this knowledge can inspire others to embrace more hugs in
            their lives.</li>
          <li>Host a Hugging Party: Gather friends and family for a cosy get-together where everyone can share hugs and
            enjoy each other’s company. You could even create fun activities centred around hugs!</li>
          <li>Send Virtual Hugs: For those who can’t be with you in person, send virtual hugs through messages or social
            media. A simple text or video call can brighten someone’s day!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let’s Hug Day is a beautiful reminder of the power of human connection. So grab your loved ones, spread some
          joy, and let the hugs flow!</p>

        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>St Nicholas Day, celebrated on 6 December in the West (and 19 December in some Eastern Christian countries),
          honours the life and legacy of Saint Nicholas, the inspiration behind Santa Claus and Father Christmas. Known
          for his kindness, St Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Myra (modern-day Turkey) who dedicated his life to
          helping the poor, sick, and children. His generosity is legendary, including secretly leaving coins in shoes,
          a tradition that inspired modern Christmas stockings.</p>

        <h5>The History of St Nicholas Day</h5>
        <p>Saint Nicholas was renowned for his charitable acts, including a famous tale where he provided dowries for
          three impoverished sisters by secretly leaving gold in their shoes. Over time, his acts of kindness inspired
          celebrations across Europe. In countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, children leave out their
          shoes or special boots on the eve of St Nicholas Day to find small gifts or treats in the morning. These
          traditions eventually influenced the creation of Santa Claus and Father Christmas as we know them today.</p>

        <h5>How to Celebrate St Nicholas Day</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave Out Shoes or Stockings: Embrace tradition by leaving shoes or stockings out for small surprises like
            chocolate coins or trinkets.</li>
          <li>Have a Feast: Celebrate with family and friends by enjoying a festive meal together.</li>
          <li>Help Someone in Need: Honour St Nicholas’s spirit by donating to charity or helping someone in your
            community.</li>
          <li>Decorate Boots or Stockings: Get creative by decorating your own St Nicholas-themed stockings or boots.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Why We Love St Nicholas Day</h5>
        <p>This day reminds us of the importance of generosity and kindness. It’s an opportunity to focus on giving
          rather than receiving, bringing families together while spreading joy and goodwill. Whether through small
          gifts, festive meals, or acts of charity, St Nicholas Day is a beautiful way to kick off the holiday season
          with love and compassion.</p>

        <h5>Description for card:</h5>
        <p>St Nicholas Day, celebrated on December 6th, honours the spirit of generosity and kindness embodied by Saint

        <p>National Pastry Day, celebrated on December 9, is a delightful occasion to indulge in the world of pastries,
          which have a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations. The earliest known pastries were created by
          the ancient Egyptians, who used grain meal and honey, while the Greeks and Romans developed thin pastry
          doughs, akin to modern phyllo. As pastries made their way to Europe during medieval times, bakers began
          incorporating fats like butter and shortening, leading to the diverse pastry varieties we enjoy today. The art
          of pastry-making reached new heights in 18th-century France, solidifying its reputation as the pastry capital
          of the world.</p>

        <h5>Activities for National Pastry Day</h5>

        <h6>Visit a Local Bakery</h6>

          town or a bustling city, local bakeries offer an array of delicious options. Enjoying these treats supports
          local businesses while satisfying your sweet tooth.</p>

          chefs like Julia Child can provide inspiration.</p>

        <h6>Make Pastry Dough from Scratch</h6>
        <p>Challenge yourself by creating pastry dough from scratch. While it may be tempting to opt for pre-made dough,
          making your own can be a rewarding experience. Gather your ingredients and spend an afternoon kneading dough,
          allowing yourself to enjoy some raw bites along the way.</p>

        <h5>Why We Celebrate National Pastry Day</h5>
        <p>National Pastry Day provides an opportunity to indulge without guilt. While pastries are not typically
          healthy foods due to their sugar and fat content, this day allows for celebration through delicious treats

          pastry chef requires extensive training and precision in measurements and techniques. The creativity needed to

          pastries aren't just sweet; they encompass savoury options too. From quiches to pop overs, there’s room for
          both main courses and desserts on this special day.</p>

        <h5>The History of National Pastry Day</h5>
        <p>Pastries have ancient roots with origins traced back to Roman and Greek cultures that utilized simple
          ingredients like flour, oil, and honey. Over time, these evolved into more complex forms with the introduction
          of butter and shortening during medieval times. The demand for pastries grew among all social classes, leading
          to a flourishing industry that continues today. Modern pastry chefs are vital in high-end culinary
          establishments, creating intricate desserts that captivate diners worldwide. National Pastry Day celebrates
          this rich heritage and the artistry behind every flaky layer.</p>

          Sorrow in 2000, it has grown into a global event that encourages education and appreciation for these
          remarkable animals.</p>

          Bhutan National Day, celebrated every year on 17 December, is a vibrant occasion that commemorates the
          coronation of the first king of Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck, in 1907. This significant holiday transforms the
          Changlimithang Stadium into a hub of festivities, where Bhutanese people gather to honour their rich history

        </p>
        <h5>History of Bhutan National Day</h5>
        <p>
          The roots of Bhutan National Day trace back to the early 17th century when the country was unified under the
          guidance of Buddhist monk Ngawang Namgyal. However, it was Ugyen Wangchuck, the Ponlop of Tongsa, who emerged
          as a pivotal figure in the late 19th century, uniting Bhutan and establishing a monarchy after abolishing the
          previous dual system of governance. His coronation on 17 December 1907 marked the beginning of the Wangchuck
          dynasty, which still reigns today as a symbol of stability and unity for the Bhutanese people.

          International Migrants Day, observed annually on 18 December, shines a spotlight on the protection of
          migrants' human rights and celebrates their invaluable contributions to societies worldwide.<br><br>
          Since time immemorial, humans have been on the move, seeking greener pastures for food, water, and shelter.
          Sometimes, conflict forced people to leave their homelands in search of new beginnings. As borders were drawn
          and nations formed, migrants often played a pivotal role in shaping new countries. Take the United States, for
          instance, established by English migrants seeking religious freedom. Between 1900 and 1915, a whopping 15
          million migrants made their way to American shores from various corners of the globe.
        </p>
        <h5>Notable Migrations Throughout History</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1944: 700,000 people fled Chechnya for Central Asia to escape Joseph Stalin's regime.</li>
          <li>1947-1950: Over 15 million people moved between India and Pakistan due to religious conflicts.</li>
          <li>1948-1950: 2 million Chinese migrants left China for Taiwan and other countries to escape communism.</li>
          <li>1882-present: 3.6 million Jews have returned to their homeland, Israel, from all over the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While migrants often leave their familiar surroundings in search of a better life, they frequently face a host
          of challenges in their new homes. These can include language barriers, poverty, employment difficulties,
          discrimination, inadequate housing, and transportation issues. Access to economic assistance and healthcare
          can
          also prove tricky.
        </p>
        <h5>How to Celebrate International Migrants Day</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Ponder how your country might be different without migrants</li>
          <li>Explore your family's migration history</li>
          <li>Chat with someone who has migrated to learn about their experiences</li>
          <li>Watch enlightening documentaries about migration, such as '4.1 Miles' or 'Human Flow'</li>
          <li>Learn about famous migrants who've made significant contributions to their adopted countries</li>
          <li>Spread awareness on social media using #MigrantsDay</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 18 December as International Migrants Day on 4 December 2000,
          recognising the growing number of migrants worldwide. The date marks the adoption of the International
          Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families in
          1990.<br><br>
          So, let's raise a cuppa to the diverse tapestry of humanity and the incredible journeys that have shaped our
          world!
